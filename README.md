# AuctionSystem
**Auction System** is an open-source web project where users can create multiple auctions, set the date of the auction and then users are able to bid for the given item. When the auction ends the user with the highest bid wins the item.



**Here's the basic architecture of this microservice template:**
* Respecting policy rules, with dependencies always pointing inward
* Separation of technology details from the rest of the system
* SOLID
* Single responsibility of each layer
